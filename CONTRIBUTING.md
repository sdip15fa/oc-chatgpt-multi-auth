- Not facilitate violations of OpenAI's Terms of Service
- Focus on legitimate personal productivity use cases
- Include appropriate user warnings and disclaimers

✅ **Respect OpenAI's Systems**
- No session token scraping or cookie extraction
- No bypassing of rate limits or authentication controls
- No reverse-engineering of undocumented APIs
- Use only officially supported authentication flows

✅ **Proper Use Cases**

- Educational purposes

❌ **Prohibited Features**
- Commercial resale or multi-user authentication
- Rate limit circumvention techniques
- Session token scraping or extraction
- Credential sharing mechanisms
- Features designed to violate OpenAI's terms

## Scope and Compliance

Contributions should stay within the project's intended scope:

- personal development workflows in OpenCode
- official OAuth authentication flows
- reliable GPT-5/Codex model support
- documentation, debugging, testing, and maintainability improvements

The project does not accept work aimed at:

- commercial resale or shared multi-user access
- bypassing safeguards, scraping sessions, or avoiding platform controls
- misleading documentation or exaggerated capability claims

## Code Standards

- **TypeScript:** All code must be TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Testing:** Include or update tests for behavioral changes
- **Documentation:** Update README.md for user-facing changes
- **Modular design:** Keep functions focused and easy to review
- **Dependencies:** Add new dependencies only when the benefit is clear

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Write clear commit messages** explaining the "why" not just "what"
3. **Include tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** (README.md, config examples, etc.)
5. **Ensure compliance** with guidelines above
6. **Test thoroughly** with the most appropriate validation for the change
7. **Complete the pull request template** with summary, testing, and compliance details
8. **Submit PR** with clear description of changes

Pull requests are automatically screened for incomplete or suspicious submissions. Legitimate contributions are still welcome, but low-signal PRs may be flagged for maintainer review before they move forward.

If a PR is flagged incorrectly, a maintainer can override the workflow with the `exempt` label after review.
